      <h2>Description</h2>
      
<h2>Evil Hangman</h2>

<pre>Welcome to evil hangman, the game of hangman that will make you pull your
hair out. Do your best to beat the computer, it's harder than it seems.</pre>

<h2>Explanation</h2>

<pre>As you could guess, this isn't your average game of hangman. In this game
the computer will cheat, putting off picking the word until the last possible
moment. The computer starts out with a dictionary of words. First you pick
a word length, then the computer narrows down the list to the given word
length. Then, every time you pick a letter, it splits up the dictionary into
several lists of words, depending on the placement of the given letter.
It then picks the largest list, and says your letter was put where it is for
the list of letters and has you guess again. Without +debug+, this game is
built to look like your average game of hangman.</pre>

<h2>Classes</h2>

<h3><a href="HangmanManager_rb.html">HangmanManager.rb</a> </h3>

<pre>manages the actual list and any modifications to it. guesses
are passed to it, and it returns the longest list along with several other
helpful functions.</pre>

<h3><a href="HangmanHandler_rb.html">HangmanHandler.rb</a></h3>

<pre>This manages all of the functions for the game itself, such as the initialization
of the game, taking the guesses, and seeing if their valid. It's essentially
the front end of the program.</pre>
